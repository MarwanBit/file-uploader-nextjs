# Sustainable Development Plan

*This document outlines a sustainable approach to implementing the features outlined in FUTURE_FEATURES.md over an extended period.*

---

## 🎯 **Development Philosophy**

### **Incremental Value Delivery**
- Each feature should provide immediate value to users
- Build features that can be released independently
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout development
- Focus on user feedback and iteration

### **Technical Sustainability**
- Keep the codebase maintainable and well-tested
- Use proven technologies and patterns
- Document decisions and architectural changes
- Regular refactoring and technical debt management

---

## ⏰ **Recommended Time Commitments**

### **Option 1: Light Development (5-8 hours/week)**
*Perfect for maintaining momentum while focusing on other priorities*

- **2-3 hours on weekends** for focused development
- **1-2 hours during week** for planning and small tasks
- **Monthly releases** with smaller, incremental features
- **Best for**: Side project maintenance, learning new technologies

### **Option 2: Moderate Development (10-15 hours/week)**
*Balanced approach for steady progress*

- **4-6 hours on weekends** for major feature development
- **2-3 hours during week** for implementation and testing
- **Bi-weekly releases** with meaningful feature additions
- **Best for**: Active project development, building portfolio

### **Option 3: Intensive Development (20+ hours/week)**
*Full-time project development*

- **8-10 hours on weekends** for major milestones
- **4-6 hours during week** for consistent progress
- **Weekly releases** with rapid iteration
- **Best for**: Startup development, career transition
