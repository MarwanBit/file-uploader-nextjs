# Architecture Overview

Below describes the system architecture of the application, you will notice that the application utilizes **Docker, Github, Vercel, Github Actions, NextJS, Amazon S3, and Clerk** for authentication. The rest of the document describes the project's structure, alongside the system design of the application.

## 1. Project Structure

Below is a visualization of the project's folder structure. The project is a NextJS application, so it inherits NextJS's folder/ file organization convention, particularly having all app routing, both frontend and backend under the **src/app/** directory. The functionality for connecting to external services is handled in the **src/lib/** folder which contains S3 and prisma clients to connect to Amazon S3, and the PostgresSQL database respectively. Additionally, the **src/services/** folder contains services which abstract away file and folder operations, connecting to **S3** and **Prisma** as needed in the corresponding functions. The core of the project is under the **src/** directory, with end2end testing handled in the **cypress/** directory.

## 2. High-Level System Diagram

Below we can see a diagram highlighting the applications high-level architecture. There a three main components of the application: **A Local Dockerized Version of the Application**, **the Remote Application located on Github, and the Vercel Deployment of the Application**. For local development, the user uses the Local Dockerized Application, where local development occurs, and testing occurs using the test PostgresSQL, Amazon S3 Bucket, and Clerk Authentication Service.

Upon pushing and merging to the main branch on the Remote Application located on Github, Github Actions runs actions that run the entire end2end and unit testing suites. While running the end2end tests, the remote deployment of the project uses the test PostgresSQL Instance, Test Amazon S3 Bucket, and Test Clerk Authentication Service. Upon successful completion of the end2end test and unit test suite, a successful merge onto main deploys the productionized version of the application to Vercel, which uses a seperate production PostgresSQL Database, production Amazon S3 Bucket, and Production Clerk Authentication Service.

### 3.1. Frontend

**Name:** File Uploader Web Application

**Description:** The frontend is a modern, responsive web application built with Next.js that provides users with an intuitive interface for managing their cloud storage. Users can upload, download, share, and organize files and folders through a familiar file-system interface. The application features a sidebar with a hierarchical folder tree, a main content area displaying folder contents in a table format, and action buttons for all file operations. Real-time feedback is provided through toast notifications, and file operations are handled asynchronously. The interface includes authentication pages (login/signup), a protected main folders view, and a public shared folder/file viewing interface accessible via share tokens.

**Technologies:**

- React 19.1.0
- Next.js 15.5.4 (App Router)
- TypeScript 5
- TailwindCSS 4 (for styling)
- ShadcnUI (component library based on Radix UI)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Lucide React & Tabler Icons (iconography)
- Sonner (toast notifications)

**Deployment:** Vercel (Production), Docker (Local Development)

### 3.2. Backend Services

The backend is built using Next.js API Routes, providing a serverless REST API architecture. All backend logic is co-located with the frontend in the Next.js application.

#### 3.2.1. File Management API

**Name:** File Operations Service

**Description:** Handles all file-related operations including file uploads, downloads, deletions, and sharing. This service generates presigned URLs for secure S3 access, manages file metadata in PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM, and enforces user ownership and permissions. Key endpoints include:

- `POST /api/files` - Upload new files
- `GET /api/files/:id` - Get file metadata and presigned download URL
- `DELETE /api/files/:id` - Delete files from S3 and database
- `POST /api/files/:id/share` - Generate shareable links with expiration

**Technologies:**

- Node.js (Next.js API Routes)
- TypeScript
- AWS SDK v3 (S3 operations)
- Prisma ORM (database operations)

**Deployment:** Vercel

#### 3.2.3. Authentication Middleware

**Name:** Clerk Authentication Middleware

**Description:** Middleware that protects routes and validates user sessions using Clerk. Intercepts all requests to protected routes (/folders/*) and API endpoints, verifying JWT tokens and redirecting unauthenticated users to login. Extracts user identity (clerk_id) for authorization checks in backend services.

**Technologies:**

- Clerk Next.js SDK
- Next.js Middleware
- JWT validation

## 4. Data Stores

The application uses two primary data stores: PostgreSQL for relational metadata and AWS S3 for binary file storage. Both have separate instances for testing and production environments.

### 4.1. PostgreSQL Database

**Type:** PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)

**Purpose:** Stores all structured metadata about files, folders, user relationships, and sharing permissions. The database maintains referential integrity through foreign keys and supports complex hierarchical queries for folder structures.

**Environments:**

- **Test Database:** Used during local development and Cypress E2E testing. Cleaned before/after each test run.
- **Production Database:** Hosted on cloud provider (e.g., Neon, Supabase, or AWS RDS), used by the Vercel deployment.

**Key Tables:**

- **Folder:** Stores folder metadata including id, folder_name, created_at, updated_at, is_root, s3_link, shared status, expires_at, parent_folder_id, owner_clerk_id, s3_key, and shareToken. Supports self-referential relationships for hierarchical folder structures.
- **File:** Stores file metadata including id, file_name, size, created_at, shared status, s3_link, expires_at, parent_folder_id, owner_clerk_id, and s3_key. Links to parent folder via foreign key.

**Access Pattern:** All database access goes through Prisma ORM using generated type-safe client. Services in `src/services/` abstract database operations.

### 4.2. Amazon S3 Bucket

**Type:** Object Storage (AWS S3)

**Purpose:** Stores the actual binary file content. Files are uploaded directly to S3 using presigned URLs for security. Each file is stored with a unique S3 key that is also tracked in the PostgreSQL database. S3 provides durable, scalable, and cost-effective storage for files of any size.

**Environments:**

- **Test Bucket:** Used during local development and automated testing. Cleaned before/after each test run.
- **Production Bucket:** Dedicated S3 bucket for production file storage with appropriate access policies.

**Access Method:**

- Files are accessed via presigned URLs generated by the backend (expiration time: ~67 minutes for downloads)
- Upload operations use presigned POST URLs
- All S3 operations use AWS SDK v3
- S3 client singleton managed in `src/lib/s3-client.ts`

**Security:** Bucket policies restrict direct public access. All file access is mediated through the application backend, which generates time-limited presigned URLs.

## 5. External Integrations / APIs

The application integrates with three primary external services for authentication, storage, and database management.

### 5.1. Clerk Authentication Service

**Purpose:** Provides complete authentication and user management solution including sign-up, sign-in, session management, and user profile management. Clerk handles password security, email verification, and JWT token generation/validation.

**Integration Method:**

- Clerk Next.js SDK (@clerk/nextjs)
- Middleware integration for route protection
- React components for authentication UI
- Server-side auth() helper for user identity extraction

**Key Features Used:**

- Username-based authentication
- Session management with JWT
- Automatic redirect flows
- Protected route handling

**Environments:** Separate Clerk projects for test and production

## 6. Deployment & Infrastructure

**Cloud Providers:** Multi-cloud architecture using Vercel (application hosting), AWS (file storage), and flexible database provider options

**Key Services Used:**

- **Vercel:** Serverless function deployment, edge functions, automatic scaling, CDN distribution
- **AWS S3:** Object storage for files
- **PostgreSQL:** Managed database service (Neon, Supabase, AWS RDS, or similar)
- **Docker:** Local development containerization (docker-compose.yml)
- **GitHub:** Version control and CI/CD trigger

**CI/CD Pipeline:**

The project implements a comprehensive CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions and Vercel:

1. **Development Phase (Local):**

   - Developers work locally using Docker Compose
   - Local environment uses test database, test S3 bucket, and test Clerk instance
   - Unit tests run via Vitest (`npm test`)
   - E2E tests run via Cypress (`npx cypress run`)
2. **Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions):**

   - Triggered on push/PR to main branch
   - Runs complete test suite (Vitest unit tests + Cypress E2E tests)
   - Uses test environment variables (configured as GitHub Secrets)
   - Cleans test database and S3 bucket before/after test runs
   - Fails merge if any tests fail
3. **Continuous Deployment (Vercel):**

   - Triggered automatically after successful merge to main
   - Vercel builds Next.js application (`npm run build`)
   - Runs Prisma migrations (`prisma migrate deploy`)
   - Generates Prisma client (`prisma generate`)
   - Deploys to production using production environment variables
   - Production uses separate database, S3 bucket, and Clerk instance
   - Automatic rollback on build failures

**Infrastructure Diagram:** See Section 2 (High-Level System Diagram)

**Configuration Management:**

- Environment variables managed separately for local/test/production
- GitHub Secrets store test environment variables
- Vercel Environment Variables store production credentials
- `.env` files for local development (not committed to version control)

## 7. Security Considerations

The application implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and ensure secure file operations.

**Authentication:**

- **Clerk JWT-based Authentication:** All users must authenticate via Clerk before accessing protected resources
- **Session Management:** Secure session handling with automatic token refresh
- **Middleware Protection:** Next.js middleware intercepts all requests to protected routes and validates JWT tokens
- **Redirect Flow:** Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to login page

**Authorization:**

- **Owner-Based Access Control:** All file and folder operations verify that the requesting user (via clerk_id) is the owner of the resource
- **Share Token System:** Files and folders can be shared via unique, cryptographically random share tokens
- **Time-Limited Sharing:** Shared resources include expiration timestamps (expires_at) for automatic access revocation
- **Public vs Private Routes:** Clear separation between authenticated routes (/folders/*) and public shared routes (/folders/shared/*)

**Key Security Practices:**

- Separation of test and production environments
- TypeScript for compile-time type safety
- ESLint for code quality and security linting
- Automated testing including security-focused E2E tests
- Environment-specific credentials (test vs. production)
